# Katelin An - Data Analysis Portfolio 

## About

Hi, I'm Katelin! I hold Bachelor of Science degree from the University of California, Santa Barbara, with a major in Psychological & Brain Sciences and a minor in Applied Psychology. I have 2 years of experience in the healthcare industry, where I held roles such as behavior therapist and clinical supervisor. In these roles, I collected behavior and skill acquisition goal data and created visualizations (i.e., graphs) to analyze data trends and make data-driven decisions. I have gained experience cleaning, coding, and analyzing large data sets in Excel, R, Python, SPSS, and Blue Sky Statistics from advanced statistic and research methods courses as well as through positions in research labs. I am currently looking to transition from the field of healthcare to data analytics.
